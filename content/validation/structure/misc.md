Whereas it is not required by [CoNLL-U specification](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html), the `MISC` column should contains a feature structure formated like the `FEATS` column.

If the `MISC` column does not meet this requirement **Grew** keep the column content in a special feature `__RAW_MISC__` (see [Grew doc](https://grew.fr/doc/conllu/#how-the-misc-field-is-handled-by-grew)).
